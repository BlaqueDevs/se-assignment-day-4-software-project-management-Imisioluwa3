## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

Waterfall: It is a linear, sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins. Like a waterfall, the process flows in one direction.

Advantages:
1. Clear structure and comprehensive documentation make it easy to understand and follow the project's progress.
2. The rigid structure simplifies management, as each phase has defined deliverables and timelines.
3. Progress tracking is straightforward due to the well-defined stages.

Disadvantages:
1. Accommodating changes is difficult once a phase is complete, leading to potential delays and increased costs.
2. Testing occurs late in the process, which can result in expensive rework if significant defects are discovered.
3. The lack of flexibility makes it less adaptable to evolving requirements, a common scenario in software development.

Agile: It is an iterative and incremental approach that prioritizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. The project is divided into short cycles (sprints) with working software delivered at the end of each sprint.

Advantages:
1. Agile excels at responding to changes quickly, as each sprint allows for adjustments based on feedback and evolving needs.
2. Continuous customer feedback ensures the project stays aligned with their expectations and reduces the risk of delivering an unwanted product.
3. Frequent communication and feedback loops foster improved team collaboration and a shared understanding of the project goals.

Disadvantages:
1. Predicting the overall timeline and budget can be challenging, particularly for larger projects, due to the iterative nature of Agile.
2. Agile requires substantial customer involvement throughout the development process, which can be demanding for some clients.
3. Implementing Agile can be difficult in organizations with rigid hierarchical structures or a resistance to change.

In summary, Waterfall is best suited for projects with stable, well-defined requirements, while Agile is more appropriate for projects with evolving requirements and a need for continuous customer feedback and adaptation. The best choice depends on the specific project context.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

Agile - More Beneficial When:
